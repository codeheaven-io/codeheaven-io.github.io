Vimium is a Chrome extension that allows you to control your browser using your keyboard. This browser extension can change your habits and let you browse in a less-distracting way. I've been using it for a week now, and I'm still in love with it.

Check the video below and fall in love with it too:

### Installation

Using google chrome? [Click here!](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb)

### Shortcuts

If you type `?` after you install it, you'll see a list containing all shortcuts. Below I'll list only the ones I'm using frequently:

  - **f** - open a link in the current tab (really useful!)
  - **F** - open a link in the current tab
  - **k/j** - scroll up/down
  - **h/l** - scroll left/right
  - **gg** (type g twice) - go to the top of the page
  - **G** (uppercase) - go to the bottom of the page
  - **u/d** - page up/down
  - **x** - close the current tab
  - **yy** - copy the page URL to your clipboard
  - **T** - search in your open tabs
  - **o** - search the web. It's easy to configure it to search for articles in wikipedia, videos in youtube, etc

### Gotchas

  - Shortcuts won't work, for an obvious reason, if your cursor is focusing a form field
  - Vimium is disabled, by default, in some pages (e.g: gmail)
  - GitHub shortcuts will stop working (not a big deal, as Vimium allows you to do everything you could with GitHub shortcuts)
